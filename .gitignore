# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/spec/dummy/log/*
/spec/dummy/tmp/*
!/spec/dummy/log/.keep
!/spec/dummy/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/spec/dummy/tmp/pids/*
!/spec/dummy/tmp/pids/
!/spec/dummy/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore databases
/spec/dummy/db/*.sqlite3

/spec/dummy/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/spec/dummy/config/master.key

.rspec_status
/coverage
